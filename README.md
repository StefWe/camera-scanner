# Camera Scanner

Use your camera to scan documents

## Installation
You need to build OpenCV by running 

    ./build-opencv.sh

This may take some time, but you only need to do this once. Now you are ready to use [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable), which is used to build and install the app. Simply run

    clickable

See [clickable documentation](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/) for details.

If you want to build the app for Desktop, you need to build the OpenCV for your computer once, too:

    ./build-opencv.sh host

Now you can build the app by running

    clickable desktop

Credits: The image processing is mainly a port of the Android app [OpenNoteScanner](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner).

This app is still under development and there is nothing to see, yet!
