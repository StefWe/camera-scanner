# Camera Scanner

Use your camera to scan documents

## Installation
Download [OpenCV sources](https://opencv.org/releases.html). Version 3.4.0 is tested. Extract the sources to **plugins/opencv**.

Install [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable), which is used to build and install the app. Simply run `clickable` from the app directory. See [clickable documentation](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/) for details. 

Credits: The image processing is mainly a port of the Android app [OpenNoteScanner](https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenNoteScanner).

This app is still under development and there is nothing to see, yet!
